HTML
	Front end
	website development

	web development
	

write HTML code we need an editor
	vs code		
	Create a new file
		give a name for the file (choose a location for the file)
		store all the hands on files in a folder (day wise)
		D:\Jag\MPhasis\HANDSON\185 Java JR\Feb15

	what are the elements you see?
		in html, elements are tags
<body>		starting tag
    
</body>		end tag

what is the root element for html file?

HTML is the root element for html file. 
All elements must be present inside the root element. 
There can be only 1 root element in a file

These rules are defined in SGML	(Standard Generalized Markup Language)

1) root element
2) only 1 root element
3) all elements must be present inside the root element

HTML program has 2 portions
1) head
2) body


we visit a web page in the browser. There are certain code which is loaded in memory even before the page is displayed
those code are written inside <HEAD> tag

whatever we want to display, should be coded inside <BODY> tag

observe:
	<p> is used to write paragaphs </p>
	by default, paragraphs appear in separate lines.
	this is because, a p element has a default style
	p {
	    display: block;				opposite to block is "inline"
	    margin-block-start: 1em;
	    margin-block-end: 1em;
	    margin-inline-start: 0px;
	    margin-inline-end: 0px;
	}

There are 2 types of display.
	i)  block

earlier i used <b> for bold but this was not block. this was inline

id attribute 

<element attribute="value">	
	attribute is a part of element
	the value of attribute must be in double quotes only. (even if it is a number)

<ol>
	<li>India</li>
	<li>Australia</li>

		1, 2, 3, 4, 5
		i, ii, iii, iv, v
		a, b, c, d, e

Task:
	Identify various ways of displaying unordered list (<ul>)


types : square, disc (default), circle, none
	ex:	
<ul type = "square">
        <li>Beetroot</li>

        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Radish</li>

        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Radish</li>
     </ul>


HTML links
	hyperlink
		when user clicks the link, it will take / navigate to some other location
		i) within same page
			<a>	means anchor	is used to give hyper link

		ii) different page

i) create a paragraph whose id is "last"
	<p id="last">
	</p>

	keep this paragraph at the bottom of the web page

ii) create a hyper link to that paragraph
	<a href="#last">click here to go to bottom</a>

Task:
	Create a html file "eight.html"
	i) create few paragraphs. (you may copy come paragraph from wikipedia or any website)
	iii) create couple of headings with id
	iv) use those IDs (with #) to create hyperlink on top and bottom or even in middle of the page.
	

TasK:
Create a html file "index.html"		(this is called as home page)
	and give hyper link to every other file present in this folder

	Instead of replacing current browser with new page, we should open the page in a new browser window.
	target = "_blank|_self|_parent|_top|framename"

while refering to documents present in our system, the hyperlink url (uniform resource locator. ex: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp)
	the hyperlink URL shall be relative (than absolute).

	while refering to external url, it shall be absolute

 <a href="D:/Jag/MPhasis/HANDSON/185%20Java%20JR/Feb15/two.html">Two</a><br>	(absolute)
    <a href="three.html">Three</a><br>						(relative)
   

absolute:	complete path
relative:	relative to the current location
			index.html belongs to a folder. from that folder, the location is mentioned
			just file name means, the file is present in the current folder
			abcd/filename.html		means, file is present in folder "abcd" which is present in the current folder
		
	./ means current folder
	../ means under the parent of current folder

	

project folder
	->	images
	->	scripts			code that refers to images means?
					images/one.jpg		(here, images must be present in current loc)
					this is not correct. 
					../images/one.jpg	(correct) because, images is a folder present under parent of current folder

	->>	styles



problems in absolute location is:
	we will move the project folder from d:\ drive to e:\ sometimes?
		absolute paths become invalid
